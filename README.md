### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Name is Bruno KÃ¶ppel (RodrÃ­guez)

- âš¡ Fun Fact: I wrote my first program when I was 14 years old. It was afterschool in my hometown of Cuba where I wrote my first hello world program in C in the Dev-C++ IDE on the computer lab, another fun fact is that they were running ubuntu distros instead of windows :o 

- ðŸ”­ I am a Programmer, sometimes a tinkerer. Currently working on a whole lot of projects which you can see in more detail at my [website](http://brunokoppel.com), always looking for cool things to build and explore.

- ðŸŽ› I make electronic music -> [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6BdSmIpqVam6MashlNUOoK?si=f8mVigR-TQaATPULzTWL-w)
